# dns-facts

This role generates facts for the [pdns-authoritative-api](https://github.com/stuvusIT/pdns-authoritative-api) role.
While this role is not required for the pdns-authoritative-api, it makes some things a lot easier.
It needs to be applied to the same host as the one pdns-authoritative-api is run before that.

### Secondary provisioning

When this role is applied to a server that should be secondary to another server, this role can automatically generate the Slave zones.
Each zone of the primary server is checked whether this server is found in the NS records of the zone, and if so, the Slave zone is created.
The name that is searched in the zone can be set, as well as the hosts which should be checked for Master (or Native) zones.

## Requirements

None

## Role Variables

All variables are optional.
If you don't want to use any features, you don't need to set any variables.
